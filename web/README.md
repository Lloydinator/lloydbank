# The Frontend of the App

If you did not create a backend, all you'll have to do is cd into the 'web' folder and run `npm install`. Once everything is installed, go to `pages/accounts/_id.vue`. Everywhere you see a link, just replace `http://localhost:8000` with `fast-shore-29582.herokuapp.com`. After that, start up the app by running `npm run dev`! 
**PLEASE NOTE:** You may have to disable CORS in your browser to post new transactions. Also initial requests may take a while if the API is 'sleeping'.

If you did create a backend, make sure the API is up and running and follow the steps above. However, this time you won't be replacing `http://localhost:8000`. Enjoy
