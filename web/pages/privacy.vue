Use 4242424242424242 to test the system out. I can't promise any email, phone number, address, etc. will not leak due to a breach. So please use dummy data as much as possible. However, the system sends out emails and texts so keep that in mind. Above all, just remember this is just a side-project and I'm just one person :)</p>
